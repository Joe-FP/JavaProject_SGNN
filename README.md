Java paired project review:

Really enjoyed working on this project, especially backend and the controller files. See specifically:

 -  src/main/java/db/DBHelper
 -  src/main/java/controllers/ArticleController
 
Given more time I would:

 -  Add a homepage with a login for the admin
 -  Allow files to be chosen from any location as opposed to a local location (when creating a new article)
 -  Tidy up the CSS (input text boxes, sizing etc.)
 -  Also started working on a method of randomly generating articles which I would like to finish
 
 Project brief below:

## SGNN News

What'**s** **G**oi**n**' O**n** News have asked you to build a web application to allow them to upload the latest Scottish news.

They want to be able to:

- Add, Edit and Remove Journalists
- Add, Edit and Remove Articles

For the front end of the website, users should be able to:

- View a list of articles, ordered by date. (Newest first!)
- Click through to the full story

(Each Article might have a headline, summary paragraph, and the full story - and any other fields you want to add.)

## Project Extensions

- Search for articles where the title includes a particular search term
- Filter articles by journalist
- Filter articles by category, which can be added by SGNN
- Track how many times an article has been read, and display a list of most popular articles
- _Paginate_ your article list - display a certain number of articles per page, with a page number, and navigation to go to the next and previous page

And other any extensions you would like to add.
